# Battleship
<i>An exercise to create a Battleship game in Java using 2d arrays</i>

<h4>The question:</h4></br>
Create a simple game of Battleship using 2D arrays.
The user should be able to position their ship in a 3x3 array, as should the computer. Each ‘player’ should take turns choosing spots in the grid until someone hits the other ship.</br>

<ul>
  <li>Note: For simplicity, each player will only have 1 ship, that takes up 1 grid slot</li>
  <li>Note: For simplicity, do not worry about repeated guesses</li>
</ul>

  </br>
I wanted to explore the JOptionPane utility a bit, and try adding an image to the input window to facilitate the user in making their choice.
The image is static.
